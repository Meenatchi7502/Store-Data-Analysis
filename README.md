# Store-Data-Analysis
Project title: Store Data Analysis.
Tools used: PowerBI.

Project Goal: 
                   Owner of Ashka Store wants us to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India. Prepare a Dashboard and share insights based on the attached data for the leads to make business decisions.

My Analysis:
                  Ashka Store sells Electronics, Furniture and Clothing online across India and wants to know the sales performance in the previous year 2018 to improve their sales in the subsequent years.
 
From the visualization of the data using PowerBi, I was able to track the sales trend across the Quarters of 2018 as well as the best-selling products and revenue metrics as shown in the dashboard.
The store received a total number of 500 orders in 2018 within 25 cities and 19 states.
Here I used Dax Formula to Find the Total Number of Orders and Sales.
Here its 5-payment Mode used, Among the 5-payment mode, cash on delivery (COD) recorded the highest.
The Electronics category had the highest sales in 2018 with total sum of 166,267, followed by the Clothing category which sales was the sum of 144,323 and the furniture which had the lowest sales with the sum of 127,181.
Here Maharashtra Has Most Number Of Orders and Tamil Nadu has Minimum Number of Orders.
In the 4th Quarter Sales is Going Down, in the 1st Quarter the sales is 161288 and in the 4th Quarter 117661 there is a downfall in Sales.
In Indore Electronics had highest sales 24902 and Clothing also had Highest Sales 21509.

Recommendations:
1.	 Encourage credit card payments by offering special offers and discounts to increase spending.
2.	Promotional offers can be increased in the month of December.
3.	The least selling products should be advertised more.
4.	Tamil Nadu Has Lowest Order, So Create targeted advertisements to attract new customers.
